# Usage
- Call 'make' in the file directory to create a raycast.exe
- Call raycast.exe with the width, height, (inputFileName).scene, (outputFileName).pmm in that order
- E.g.     .\raycast.exe 500 500 redball.scene output.ppm
- The output file will be created for you if one does not exist.

- Note: ( I have edited the sphere position Y of redball.scene to perfectly match the example shown on Canvas)

# Known Issues
- I think the y direction is inverted, smaller numbers make the ball go higher.
